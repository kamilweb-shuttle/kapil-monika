						<p>It is a rare affair when two gifted individuals with such ingenious talent get an opportunity to not only 

spend their life together, but also work in sync. Kapil&mmonika launched their eponymous label in year 

2006. When they realized serious lacunae in the category of ‘customized couture’. Kapil&mmonika has 

a wide range of creativity. However, femininity forms the essence of the label with styles that signify 

youth, glamour and sophistication. Inspired by anything beautiful, they always had an extremely 

romantic design philosophy with styles that are luxurious yet understated.</p>
